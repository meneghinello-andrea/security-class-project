\section*{\small \textsc{conclusion}}
There are two schools of thought on security in \ac{SDN}. The first is that significant improvements in network security can be achieved by simultaneously exploiting the programmability and the centralized network view introduced by \ac{SDN}. The second is that these same two \ac{SDN} attributes expose the network to a range of new attacks. In this article, we have categorized the \ac{SDN} security challenges and presented a simple review of the research work on security in \ac{SDN}. My analysis identifies that regardless of your school of thought, there is yet more to be done; more untapped potential and more unresolved challenges. A concerted effort in both directions could yield a truly secure and reliable \ac{SDN}.
