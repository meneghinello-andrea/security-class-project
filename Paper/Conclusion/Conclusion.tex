\section*{\small\textsc{conclusion}}
\ac{SDN} introduces new features in network management but, as in every new work, introduces also security issues. In this work we have listed some network weaknesses and relative improvements. This work does not want to be exhaustive; there are also other solutions to cited problems and problems that are not treated here. From this paper it is clear that much work has been done in solving the bug in security but much work is still to do.
