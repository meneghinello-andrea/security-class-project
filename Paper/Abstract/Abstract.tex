\section*{\small \textsc{abstract}}
\ac{SDN} has become one of the most important architecture for network management. \ac{SDN} and the OpenFlow communication protocol are used in complex large scale networks where reconfiguration and re-policing, in real time, are critical requests. These requests are fulfilled by the separation of the \ac{CP} from the \ac{DP}. Thus the network routers/switches simply forward the packets following the flow table rules set by the \ac{CP}. Currently OpenFlow is the most popular \ac{SDN} protocol/standard and has a set of design specifications. Although \ac{SDN} and OpenFlow is a relatively new research area which has attracted much attention from both academia and industry.

In this paper we conduct a brief survey of the research relating the security enhancement and security challenges using \ac{SDN} framework, by categorizing the existing works and finally presenting the state of the art.
