\section*{\small \textsc{abstract}}
The pull of \ac{SDN} is magnetic. There are few in the networking community who have escaped its impact. As the benefits of network visibility and network device programmability are discussed, the question could be asked as to who exactly will benefit? Will it be the network operator or will it, in fact, be the network intruder? as \ac{SDN} devices and system hit the market, security in \ac{SDN} must raised on the agenda. This paper present a brief survey of the research relating to security in \ac{SDN} that has been carried out to date. Both the security enhancements to be derived from using the \ac{SDN} framework and the security challenges introduced by the framework are discussed. By categorizing the existing work finally a set of conclusion are presented.
